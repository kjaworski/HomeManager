    Task<TodoSuggestionResponse> GenerateTodoSuggestionsAsync(
        TodoSuggestionRequest request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
        
    /// <summary>
    /// Analyze receipt image and extract expense information.
    /// </summary>
    Task<ReceiptAnalysisResponse> AnalyzeReceiptAsync(
        ReceiptAnalysisRequest request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
        
    /// <summary>
    /// Generate family insights and recommendations.
    /// </summary>
    Task<FamilyInsightsResponse> GenerateInsightsAsync(
        FamilyInsightsRequest request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

### MCP Server Integration
```typescript
// MCP Server Framework
interface MCPServer {
  name: string;
  capabilities: string[];
  endpoint: string;
  authentication: MCPAuthConfig;
}

// Todo MCP Server
class TodoMCPServer implements MCPServer {
  name = 'todo-intelligence';
  capabilities = [
    'task-suggestion',
    'priority-optimization',
    'pattern-analysis',
    'delegation-recommendation'
  ];
  
  async suggestTasks(context: FamilyContext): Promise<TaskSuggestion[]> {
    // AI-powered task suggestion logic
  }
  
  async optimizePriorities(tasks: Task[]): Promise<OptimizedTaskList> {
    // Priority optimization based on family patterns
  }
}
```

### Amazon Bedrock Integration
```csharp
// Bedrock Service Configuration
public class BedrockConfiguration
{
    public string Region { get; set; } = "us-east-1";
    public string DefaultModel { get; set; } = "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0";
    public string FastModel { get; set; } = "anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0";
    public int MaxTokens { get; set; } = 4096;
    public double Temperature { get; set; } = 0.1;
    public TimeSpan Timeout { get; set; } = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);
}

// Bedrock Service Implementation
public class BedrockService : IBedrockService
{
    public async Task<AIResponse> InvokeModelAsync(
        AIRequest request,
        string modelId = null,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        // Amazon Bedrock model invocation logic
        // Includes prompt optimization and response processing
    }
}
```
