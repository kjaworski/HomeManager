/// Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
/// 
/// AI Context: This service integrates with:
/// - PostgreSQL for user data persistence
/// - JWT for authentication tokens
/// - AWS Cognito for federated authentication
/// - Family management for multi-tenant user relationships
/// </summary>
public interface IUserService
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Registers a new user account with email verification.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="request">User registration details</param>
    /// <param name="cancellationToken">Cancellation token</param>
    /// <returns>User registration result with verification token</returns>
    Task<UserRegistrationResult> RegisterAsync(
        UserRegistrationRequest request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```
